Attwood"],"categories":["Synopsis","immunology","phylogenetics","virology"],"content":"    Note If there is unfamiliar terminology here, then it may help to read these posts in order, starting with \u0026ldquo;Is SARS-CoV-2 evolving?\u0026rdquo; of 7th June 2020. Definitions of terms are in bold to help in finding them.\nPhylogenetics can give clues about how SARS-CoV-2 battles the anti-viral responses of its hosts―two recent papers considered the C-\u0026gt;U hypermutation which, like other coronaviruses, is a feature of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Peter Simmonds\u0026rsquo; preprint focused on treating the low CpG content of the CoV genomes as a phylogenetic character that tells us something about events in their history, and the paper by Salvatore Giorgio et al (2020) gives further examination of the anti-viral aspects. Simmonds noted that there are about four times the number of C-\u0026gt;U transitions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome than expected by chance, which is high even among RNA viruses, and that around half of non-synonymous mutations are C-\u0026gt;U substitutions―suggesting they might be important in the evolution of the virus (but see below). This excess increases 10-fold if the C-\u0026gt;U is flanked by a certain motif (i.e. specific sequence pattern), which Simmonds noted are favoured by certain APOBEC proteins. Some APOBECs are thought able to introduce mutations to RNA viral genomes by deamination of cytidines, with the mutations introduced as an anti-viral defence. The fact that these viruses show low GC content, but the G+A content is relatively normal, would fit with an APOBEC acting on the genomic (positive) strand of the virus, exposed in the cytoplasm, before replication complex formation―otherwise both strands would be present, and susceptible to mutation as the genome is replicated―the GA content would then fall with the GC. The same idea (lack of symmetry) argues against the mutations being errors of the viral RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, the enzyme that the viruses uses to copy its own genome). APOBEC RNA-editing would also explain the strangely high dN/dS ratio in SARS-CoV-2 because it would not be shaped by natural selection. Indeed, we would have APOBEC introducing variants and natural selection removing any that were deleterious. Of course, we can imagine that these viruses would evolve to avoid using sequences that APOBECs target; however, there is a diverse family of APOBECs and they vary among host species. Simmonds observed that the hypermutation is greatest in close relatives of SARS-CoV-2 and reduces as more divergent lineages are considered; this could be because the human SARS-CoVs have only recently begun to infect humans, whereas the seasonal CoVs that have long circulated in humans have adapted to our APOBECs and restored their GC content. The implication is that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are still adapted to bat APOBECs (or to whatever the ancestral hosts were). Giorgio et al. take the story a little further, and look at another deanimase family, the ADARs, as well as APOBEC; they found frequently overrepresented stop codons in transcribed viral RNAs rather than genomic, which supported an anti-viral role for these enzymes.\nAs we tend to learn most from papers that attract criticism, I should mention the paper in MBE by Xia (2020) here. Xia came up with a nice idea (those are often the ones that draw flak), as he found CpG levels in some canine alphacoronaviruses as low as in SARS-CoV-2, the record holder for low CpG among these CoVs (although human seasonal cold virus CoV HKU1 might be lower). He reasoned that the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 may have been subjected to a canine immune environment, and on that basis argued that SARS-CoV-2 jumped from bats to some canine and then to humans. In a recent (aren't they all?) preprint Digard et al (2020) aligned nearly 200 genomes of SARS-CoVs and various coronaviruses transmitting in animals. They found that although CpG levels were lowest in human and canine coronaviruses and highest in bat and rodent, there was much range overlap, which makes Xia's nice idea more shaky. These authors all noted that the low CpG may well be to avoid the action of Zinc-finger Antiviral Protein (ZAP), which binds to viral RNAs at their CpG motifs (an addition to the APOBEC explanation). Interestingly, Digard's group found almost normal CpG levels at two loci, E ORF and the coding region of ORF10 (an ORF is an Open Reading Frame, the coding part of a gene that can be translated, but viruses can have overlapping ORFs, or \u0026ldquo;sub-ORFs\u0026rdquo; if you like, that's not an official term!). These two loci also showed much less CpG suppression than the rest of their genomes in bat- and pangolin-CoVs sampled nearly a decade ago. The implication is that selection had not removed this pattern over the years, and so it is a derived trait that was selected for before SARS-CoVs began to transmit widely among humans. In support of this, a phylogenetic tree estimated with only E ORF sequences for the 7 human-CoVs and 96 bat-CoVs showed the human-CoVs scattered among the bat-CoV lineages and with CpG levels matching their closest bat-CoV relatives. They suggest that the high CpG in E ORF might be because it is transcribed late in the infection process, when attack by ZAP is less of a problem.\nThe E ORF story is a good example of how phylogenetics can help us understand the anti-viral reponses during infection, and the strategies SARS-CoV-2 has been using to avoid them as it evolved and moved from host to host. Now let's look at some sequencing studies on the immune response itself.\nAPOBECS are part of the interferon-induced innate immune response (they have links with adaptive response too, but that is another topic), but Galson et al (2020) use sequencing data, and a nearest-neighbour kind of clustering algorithm, to directly explore the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2. They compared the IGHA and IGHG B-Cell Receptor (BCR) sequences for 19 patients with those for healthy individuals. The numbers of mutations showed a bimodal frequency plot (i.e. two humps), which suggests an expanding population―i.e. a population of B-cells that had only just \u0026ldquo;switched\u0026rdquo; on to the presence of the virus. Nevertheless, the larger clonal expansions revealed by the sequence network showed many mutations, which fits with their having activated from memory of a previously encountered antigen. Convergent BCR sequences were also seen, with very similar sequences among different patients, and even between UK and US studies; this convergence is good news for vaccine development, as it implies that a vaccine that works across diverse lineages of virus is feasible. We also saw signs of activation from memory.\nTo counter that possibly good news, Cheng et al. (2020)\u0026lsquo;s preprint is potentially worrying, but models are never perfect so\u0026hellip;. These authors modelled the shape (and charge) of the \u0026ldquo;spike\u0026rdquo; protein, which is what the virus uses to recognise ACE2 receptors on our cells and trigger the process of cell entry. The models indicated a 20 amino acid motif in spike that mimics a superantigen called staphylococcal entero-toxin B (SEB), which is known to be the trigger for toxic shock or the cytokine storm in humans. In SARS-CoV-2 the motif appears to be palindromic so, when the reverse direction is also included, this doubles the stretch of sequence to match with the superantigen peptide. The superantigen motif is not found in any other SARS coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV from the 2002-2004 outbreak. Probably most controversially the models indicate that some Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs, or substitutions at a single site that persist in a population at non-negligible frequencies) currently circulating in Europe and the US may increase the superantigenicity of the SEB-like motif. Among these is the infamous D641G, which I have to write about next, which may interact with MHCII to strengthen the association with T-cell receptors involved in cytokine storm initiation. The authors suggest that this may explain the higher rates of cytokine storm in Europe and US and the appearance in Europe of SARS-CoV-2 related inflammatory syndrome in children. It is important to note that without a heap of empirical evidence to back these suggestions, the indications of computer models are just that, indications only. After all, there are many possible explanations for many things!\nPS Just for fun, you may want to think about what the implications are of C-\u0026gt;G hypermutation, especially by APOBECs, on phylogenetics (i.e. on estimating evolutionary trees). How might that affect our SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary trees?\nTop image: \u0026ldquo;Heatmap of the 777 convergent COVID-19-associated clonotypes (observed between 4 or more COVID-19 participants)\u0026rdquo; by Galson, J.

Attwood"],"categories":["Review","epidemiology","phylogenetics","virology"],"content":"    An April 28th paper featuring a SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree provoked the ire of many evolutionary virologists―the paper (Forster et al. 2020) appeared in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA (PNAS) which is a prestigious journal, so what could have upset the evolutionary biology community so much? Alarm bells probably began to ring at this point in the abstract \u0026lsquo;The network faithfully traces routes of infections for documented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, indicating that phylogenetic networks can likewise be successfully used to help trace undocumented COVID-19 infection sources\u0026rsquo;. First problem is that SARS-CoV-2 transmits itself on average once a week, but it accumulates variants around once a fortnight, so there is not the resolution to unravel a series of transmissions close together in time. A bigger problem is sampling―the authors infer a chain of transmission from China to Germany to Italy to Mexico, but this is not at all certain. If a \u0026ldquo;German\u0026rdquo; variant was quite common in China (or Italy) but was not often sampled because, for example, sampling was biased to cases in a particular city hospital and by chance this variant was common in a rural area, then it can appear that a variant arose in Germany and passed to Italy, when in fact it came from a third country. Last but not least, the authors observed certain variants in certain parts of the world that defined lineages on their tree (East Asian, European, and US/Australian) and they proposed that this divergence was due to selection for variants that favoured the virus in each particular part of the world. In fact there was no reason to imagine selection and adaptation because founder effects can explain their tree, without any selection. As people caught flights around the world, some variants went with them and some did not, and some were transmitted onward in the other countries and some were not. The result was founding populations in each region that differed, each with its own spectrum of variants and their frequencies, but all shaped by chance. As the outbreaks grew into a pandemic, these differences were amplified, because a common variant is more likely to be involved in a transmission event (so making it more common), to produce the differences that Forster et al. attributed to selection. A variant a low frequency is more likely to be lost by chance, for example only a few self-isolating cases need to be effective. We call this accidental loss genetic drift because the variant frequencies drift by chance (selection isn't pushing them). Some variants are lost by chance, and some might reach quite high percentages in the populations.\nTang et al. 2020 attracted similar criticism when they inferred selection for the virus during its first entry into the human population. The first problem was, again that one lineage had been inferred to be spreading faster and coming to dominate the population. The authors defined two \u0026ldquo;strains\u0026rdquo; (we prefer to call them lineages, until a very convincing case has been made for real biological differences among them) on the basis of posession of two variants (one of which was non-synonymous, i.e. it changed the amino acid coded for). The S (for serine) lineage lacked the variants (relative to the ancestral genome, which should be oldest SARS-CoV-2 genome we can find or infer, but this is a separate problem, see below) and the L (for leucine) lineage had them. Consequently, Tang et al. regarded the \u0026ldquo;S-strain\u0026rdquo; as ancestral, and L as derived from it. As L was derived, but more common (then ~70% of isolates sequenced) than S, the authors assumed that L had arisen and outcompeted S. The assumption that S is \u0026ldquo;evolutionarily older and less aggressive\u0026rdquo; can be questioned, as we did above with regard to founder effects. A second problem here is that of sampling bias, because only detected cases get sequenced, and detected cases are often related to one another (i.e. not independent samples). For example, a particular hospital might have good links with a sequencing consortium and so many genomes are sequenced from its locality, our database are also biased towards cases in cities. On top of this, the scope and depth of sampling varies by country―by early March most of the cases were in China, but 60% of the genomic data were coming from cases elsewhere.\nThe second problem is a little more subtle. The authors aimed to detect selection using the number of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitutions (substitutions are mutations that stick in a population through the time we sample). If part of the genome (called a locus) has a low dN/dS it could be that purifying selection is removing genomes with altered amino acid sequences, so as to keep the locus unchanged, except for synonymous changes that only affect the RNA sequence, not the protein. We might then regard such conserved loci as important to success of the virus in some way. The first problem with this relates to sequencing errors; these are rare, because unlike real mutations they can't be transmitted, and have a higher non-synonymous to synonymous ratio because, again unlike real mutations, they have equal chance of occurring at a first codon as at a third codon. Consequently, such errors can cause an apparent excess of low-frequency non-synonymous substitutions which will mimic purifying selection. Second, because in a population there are always more non-synonymous substitutions than synonymous ones, and because most mutations are rare, there is more chance of sampling a synonymous substitution many times; this makes non-synonymous mutations look rarer than they really are.\nFinally, there was a view that Tang et al. had a problem with their rooting. The root of a phylogenetic tree (or a cluster of branches on a tree, which can be called a clade) is where you decide to put the origin of all the organisms, phylogenetics calls the things on a tree taxa (singular taxon), so the root is the ancestor of all the taxa on the tree. The derived taxa on the authors\u0026rsquo; tree should be those with a substitution relative to the sequence for the last common ancestor of the epidemic in China; however, it looked like they had used the Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) not of the epidemic, but of the virus (SARS-CoV-2) and its closest known relative, the bat-CoV (bat coronavirus) RaTG13. The evolutionary distance back to this MRCA (the one with the bat-CoV) is much greater than that to the MRCA of the epidemic, because the time scales are decades, not months. The bigger distance allows back mutations (back to the ancestral state) to occur, so we won't be able to tell which substitutions are derived and which are not. The problem of back mutation will affect new synonymous mutations more than new non-synonymous ones because synonymous sites have higher substitution rates. The back mutation is back to the real common ancestor of the epidemic, and can be removal of slightly harmful mutations by positive selection, but it looks like a derived mutation away from the MRCA with the bat-CoV. So we can see the effect of not using the MRCA of the epidemic as the root, in a study where we are looking for selection in the epidemic (not the wrong root, but the wrong root for this particular analysis)―the effect is that the faux \u0026ldquo;derived\u0026rdquo; substitutions make it look like we have an excess of high-frequency synonymous substitutions when we don't, and to a potentially false conclusion of purifying selection.\nThe authors also identified \u0026ldquo;derived\u0026rdquo; variants that they presented as favouring transmission or virulence, but this was not convincing to many researchers. You can read more about these problems in MacLean et al 2020 and for a general warning of the pitfalls relating to inferring selection and new virulent strains of SARS-CoV-2, this is a good read Villabona-Arenas, Hanage \u0026amp; Tully, 2020. I think the general rule is, try not to get lost in your own analysis.

In the 2006 outbreak BTV spread to affect 16 countries and killed many livestock animals, particularly sheep, with losses to European agriculture in the billions of Euros. BTV is an arthropod-borne virus of ruminants and was considered successfully controlled through vaccination by early 2010, but is now enzootic to France. Consequently, David Pascall, Kyriaki Nomikou, and colleagues in Glasgow and across Europe, sought to explain the unexpected outbreak in France by applying phylogenetics to a data-set of 164 complete BTV-8 genomes sampled throughout the first (2006-2009) and second (2015) outbreaks. Cessation of vaccination in 2010 was followed by a steady decline in seropositivity in cattle until 2014; thus a reintroduction (rather than cryptic sub-clinical transmission) appeared likely. To avoid culture effects most samples were taken directly from infected cattle. The phylogeny showed genomes of the second outbreak to be monophyletic (all in one clade or lineage, with no other genomes mixed in) and entirely nested within those of the first. Notably, the branch linking the two outbreaks was suspiciously short given the substitution rate of BTV-8 and the five years between the outbreaks. The ancestral sequence was reconstructed for the second outbreak and found to differ at only 4 sites from its closest relative in the first epidemic, whereas samples collected in 2006 differed from those in 2008 by up to 56 sites. Indeed root-to-tip regression (of tree branch lengths against sampling times), applied to a tree that included the reconstructed ancestor of the second outbreak, dated the ancestor as having been circulating in late March 2008. The authors were able to effectively rule out dormancy in some life-stage of the arthropod vector, and latency in some accessory host, because five years was just too long. Noting that BTV has been detected in the semen of viraemic bulls and rams, the authors proposed that the 2015 outbreak may have arisen from use of frozen semen, embryos or colostrum, which is a common practice in livestock farming. The study has been published in PLoS Biology and is available open-access directly from the publisher here.\nTop image: \u0026ldquo;Timescaled phylogenetic tree of BTV-8 samples collected during the European outbreaks between 2006 and 2018\u0026rdquo; by Pascall DJ, Nomikou K, Bréard E, Zientara S, Filipe AdS, Hoffmann B, et al. 2020, used under CC.\n","date":1588585726,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588585726,"objectID":"ccf757108d3d1feaad8b5cbbf98497fc","permalink":"http://InfrPopGen.github.io/blog/frozenevol/","publishdate":"2020-05-04T10:48:46+01:00","relpermalink":"/blog/frozenevol/","section":"blog","summary":"This investigation into the recrudescence of Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) in France in 2015 is a fine example of phylogenetic epidemiology going detective to explain the reappearance of this virus, once thought erradiacted.

Attwood"],"categories":["Research Advance","Pre-clinical"],"content":"    In blog post \u0026ldquo;An Eye for Nature\u0026rdquo; we looked at artificial retina solutions for degenerative conditions like AMD that are common cause of blindness in humans. As a follow up I would like to mention a 2019 paper which offers an amazingly simple potential treatment for such retinal damge.\nThe authors noted that, whilst the opsins, the protein part of light-sensitive receptors found in the rod and cone cells of the human retina, are normally embedded in the molecular complex of the G-protein-coupled-receptor signalling cascade that amplifies and moderates (through feedback loops) the signal from the photoreceptive pigments, these complexes are common to many kinds of cells not just rods and cones. They were also aware that although the rods and cones are lost in many retinal degenerative diseases, the main nerve cells of the retina, the retinal ganglion cells, are not lost and remain active albeit insensitive to light. Putting these two facts together led them to ask the question, if we put the genes coding for a retinal photoreceptor into retinal ganglion cells might the opsins automatically integrate into the ganglions\u0026rsquo; G-protein signalling complexes, without the need to somehow transplant the entire opsin-signalling complex? To address this they used an Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) to carry the gene coding for green cone cell opsin into the genome of the retinal ganglion cells of blind mice. Although many neuroscientists would have said that this simple approach should not work, the experiment did in fact work. The blind mice were not only able to pass several of the tests used in humans to test eyesight (and were almost indistiguishable from normal mice in such tests), but their transformed ganglia even adjusted the photo-response according to the light level, turning the signal up in low light and down in bright light!\nAlthough the findings appear miraculous, there is some way to go before this technique can be used to treat people. Although the AAV used specifically infects retinal ganglion cells, and so can be precisely targeted, there are issues of insertional mutagenesis because the viral genome can insert itself into the cells\u0026rsquo; genomes at random positions (this can potentially cause cancer or loss of essential gene function—for more on this see this paper). The authors note that because the human eye contains thousands of times more ganglion cells than that of the mouse, much larger doses of AAV would be needed to treat a human. Nevertheless, AAV vectors have been FDA approved for use in human degenerative retinal conditions in cases where there is alternative treatment. The treatment might not be suitable for treatment of all retinal degenerative diseases because the retinal ganglion cells do not survive in all such conditions. In [retinitis pigmentosa](https://www.rnib.org.uk/eye-health/eye-conditions/retinitis-pigmentosa), the target disease of these authors, 30% to 75% of these cells survive relative to normal eyes (for details see this paper, whereas in wet AMD over half of the cells are lost. In dry AMD the approach is most promising as cell survival in this case is as good as in normal eyes (for more see this paper); however, we need to consider that these cells are also lost with ageing and the conditions to be treated are mostly those of old age. Nevertheless, the finding has great potential in the treatment of retinal degenerative disease.\n","date":1576951117,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576951117,"objectID":"69e5e0dbb19da82cf9b9315c20ec22b5","permalink":"http://InfrPopGen.github.io/blog/3mice/","publishdate":"2019-12-21T17:58:37Z","relpermalink":"/blog/3mice/","section":"blog","summary":"A team led by Ehud Isacoff and John Flannery at University of California—Berkeley have found a surprisingly simple way to restore sight after retinal damage!","tags":["Regenerative Medicine"],"title":"Three Blind Mice See Again!","type":"blog"},{"authors":["S.W. Attwood"],"categories":["Research Advance","Pre-clinical"],"content":"    Retinal degenerative disorders, such as Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), affect millions of people around the world. In the UK alone, AMD is the main cause of loss of sight, affecting over 600,000 people. In all of these disorders, the photoreceptor cells lining the retina at the back of the eye lose function, which leads to the loss of sight. Available treatments are at best capable of only slowing the degeneration in some individuals. The devastating impact of these disorders on human wellbeing and the lack of a cure have prompted researchers to seek radical solutions to the problem. The idea they came up with was to replace the damaged retina with an artificial one, and the development of such ‘bionic’ eyes has exploded into a wide range of devices and systems. The US Department of Energy even ran its own Artificial Retina Project leading to the first clinical trial Argus I in 2002 in which six patients received ‘bionic’ eye implants. By 2006, trials of the Argos II device had been carried out in 30 patients across Europe and the United States. By 2011 the device was approved for clinical use in Europe and by 2013 70 people had received these implants. Unfortunately, these retinal prosthetics use arrays of electrodes or photodiodes to convey small pulses of electricity to mimic the action of the lost retinal cells by stimulating the nerves of the retina; they are therefore limited by the density of photoreceptors and by the weight and bulk of the materials used. Consequently, these implants generate very low resolution images and are of benefit only to those with extensive sight loss.\nFortunately, a team at the University of Oxford’s Department of Chemistry, and led by Dphil student Vanessa Restrepo-Schild stepped in with an innovative solution to many of the problems faced by these ‘digital camera’ style implants. Restrepo-Schild realised that the scarring and inflammation caused by such devices, which limited their utility, could be avoided by building a retina out of biological materials―using only materials that occur naturally in the eye. Consequently she set about building a photosensitive array similar to that of the retina from materials normally used in cell culture. The resulting implant would be not only less inflammatory, but also more soft and flexible to mimic better the original retina. Vanessa Restrepo-Schild realised that the hydrogels normally used in the laboratory had the right strength and flexibility for the job, but the team developed their own tailored gel for the purpose.\nTo emulate the light response function of the retina, they developed what they called ‘synthetic cells’, which were produced by arranging water droplets on the hydrogel in a lipid-containing oil. A lipid bilayer then formed naturally around each droplet, creating a ‘synthetic cell’. The cells were made photosensitive by adding the light-driven proton pump, bacteriorhodopsin, to the water droplets. In addition to flexibility and compatibility, the tiny water droplets can achieve arrays with greater pixel density than the ‘digital camera’ style devices. The approach is particularly neat because, as Restrepo-Schild points out, their synthetic retina already speaks the same language as the underlying nerve cells, and so should generate electrical impulses exactly as the real retina would. The impulses, when passed to the brain, are likely to be interpreted more readily as natural sight. Restrepo-Schild’s next step is to create, in fact print on their lab’s bespoke 3D printer, a 3D version of the device and observe how it communicates with nerve cells in tissue culture. The team is confident that they will soon have a system able to not only recognise colours, but also shapes and patterns, prior to preclinical testing and then clinical trials.\nRestrepo-Schild cites her childhood fascination with the difference between the living and the machine as the source of her inspiration. She has long been pondering the idea of using parts of our own living bodies in devices that would not themselves be living, but would function as in vivo. We at Bang! are thankful that her childhood interests never faded, and rather proud that this potentially life changing research was done here, in Oxford.\nVanessa Restrepo-Schild is a student in the laboratory of Professor Hagan Bayley and their original research paper can be found here: www.nature.com/articles/srep46585.\n","date":1575992328,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575992328,"objectID":"5cb4b36327b49326bd820a5b35dce2b1","permalink":"http://InfrPopGen.github.io/blog/eye4nature/","publishdate":"2019-12-10T15:38:48Z","relpermalink":"/blog/eye4nature/","section":"blog","summary":"This is a sligtly updated version of an article I wrote for _Bang!_ (TT17 issue):","tags":["Regenerative Medicine"],"title":"An Eye for Nature","type":"blog"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Nevertheless, several major challenges remain to be addressed before iPSC-derived cells can be used in therapy, and experience of their clinical use is extremely limited. In this review, the factors affecting the safe translation of iPSC to the clinic are considered, together with an account of efforts being made to overcome these issues. The review draws upon experiences with pluripotent stem-cell therapeutics, including clinical trials involving human embryonic stem cells and the widely transplanted mesenchymal stem cells. The discussion covers concerns relating to: (i) the reprogramming process; (ii) the detection and removal of incompletely differentiated and pluripotent cells from the resulting medicinal products; and (iii) genomic and epigenetic changes, and the evolutionary and selective processes occurring during culture expansion, associated with production of iPSC-therapeutics. In addition, (iv) methods for the practical culture-at-scale and standardization required for routine clinical use are considered. Finally, (v) the potential of iPSC in the treatment of human disease is evaluated in the light of what is known about the reprogramming process, the behavior of cells in culture, and the performance of iPSC in pre-clinical studies.","tags":["evolution","stem cell","stem cell therapy","safety","adverse event","clinical translation","genetic stability","pluripotent stem-cell","stem-cell research"],"title":"iPS-Cell Technology and the Problem of Genetic Instability—Can It Ever Be Safe for Clinical Use?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen Attwood"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

Despite numerous phylogenetic studies only one DNA-sequence based population-genetic study of N. aperta had been published, and the origin, structure and persistence of N. aperta were poorly understood. Consequently, a phylogenetic and population genetic study was performed, with addition of new data to pre-existing DNA-sequences for N. aperta from remote and inaccessible habitats, including one new taxon from Laos and 505 bp of additional DNA-sequence for all sampled taxa,. Principal findings Spatial Principal Component Analysis revealed the presence of significant spatial-genetic clustering. Genetic-distance-based clustering indicated four populations with near perfect match to a priori defined ecogeographical regions. Spring-dwelling taxa were found to form an ecological isolate relative to other N. aperta. The poor dispersal capabilities suggested by spatial-genetic analyses were confirmed by Bayesian inference of migration rates. Population divergence time estimation implied a mid-Miocene colonisation of the present range, with immediate and rapid radiation in each ecogeographical region. Estimated effective population sizes were large (120–310 thousand). Conclusions The strong spatial-genetic structure confirmed the poor dispersal capabilities of N. aperta—suggesting human-mediated reintroduction of disease to controlled areas as the primary reason for control failure. The isolation of the spring-dwelling taxa and ecogeographical structure suggests adaptation of sub-populations to different habitats; the epidemiological significance of this needs investigation. The large effective population sizes indicate that the high population densities observed in surveyed habitats are also present in inaccessible areas; affording great potential for recrudescence driven by animal-reservoir transmission in remote streams. Mid-Miocene colonisation implies heterochronous evolution of these snails and associated schistosomes and suggests against coevolution of snail and parasite. Heterochronicity favours ecological factors as shapers of host-parasite specificity and greater potential for escape from schistosomiasis control through host-switching.","tags":["Phylogenetic analysis","Phylogenetics","Phylogeography","Population genetics","Snails","Schistosoma","Cambodia","Rivers"],"title":"Population genetic structure and geographical variation in Neotricula aperta (Gastropoda: Pomatiopsidae), the snail intermediate host of Schistosoma mekongi (Digenea: Schistosomatidae)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.W.

In spite of several decades of intensive coordinated control schistosomiasis still infects around 1 million people in China. In order to understand the potential for spread of the disease into new areas and new snail species, it is helpful to know if the snails and parasites in China are coevolved; this means that evolutionary divergence in one group (the snails) is matched by a corresponding divergence in the other (the parasites), which is what would be expected if the two groups are locked in an evolutionary arms race. DNA-sequence data were collected for snails and parasites from the same localities. The findings indicated that coevolution was unlikely to have occurred. The implications of this are that host-switching or acquisition is more likely than previously thought. Consequently, there is a greater potential for spread of the parasite into new areas. The role of mountain barriers in confining schistosomiasis to certain regions was highlighted; this is important in view of the current plans to breach these barriers by road and rail construction that will link China and Southeast Asia.","tags":null,"title":"Comparative Phylogenetic Studies on Schistosoma japonicum and Its Snail Intermediate Host Oncomelania hupensis: Origins, Dispersal and Coevolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.W.

It was assumed that these snails had been introduced to Hong Kong via the import of tropical fish by air from South America. In 2012 Biomphalaria were found for the first time in Guangdong Province, China. In view of the renewed interest in these invasive snails, a morphological and DNA-sequence based phylogenetic study was undertaken for seven populations of Biomphalaria snails collected in Guangdong. Morphologically and phylogenetically, five of the populations clustered more closely with Biomphalaria kuhniana than with B. straminea. Levels of genetic diversity among the populations were about half those of autochthonous populations in Brazil, the phylogenetic relationships did not correlate with a radiation from any one international port in China, and different lineages appeared associated with different ports. Consequently in explaining the current distribution of the snails, multiple colonization events, each establishing a new local snail population near to maritime international container ports, were considered more likely than the spread of snails from Hong Kong to China. The displacement of B. straminea by B. kuhniana in Guangdong is considered as an explanation for the habitat changes observed among the snails between Hong Kong in the 1980s and the present. The conclusions of the study are that any risk of Schistosoma mansoni transmission in China is more likely to come from parasite importation in the intramolluscan stage, than from transmission by migrant workers from South America or Africa. In addition, although likely to be rare, sporadic outbreaks of imported schistosomiasis (caused by invading infected snails) could be a threat to public health in the vicinity of International container ports (not only in Guangdong Province). Further work is called for to investigate further the presence of B. kuhniana and its potential interactions with B. straminea (the former is thought to be incompatible with S. mansoni), and the responses of Chinese Biomphalaria to potential competitors such as Thiaridae. The current expansion of container ports in Brazil and Venezuela, and the increase in trade with China, is likely to accentuate any current risk of imported schistosomiasis, and surveillance around ports in China, together with further research, are necessary.","tags":["China","Schistosomiasis","Gastropoda","Biomphalaria","invasive species","phylogenetic"],"title":"Update on the distribution and phylogenetics of Biomphalaria (Gastropoda: Planorbidae) populations in Guangdong Province, China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.W.

Also, with around 120 species, triculine biodiversity exceeds that of any other endemic freshwater molluscan fauna. Nevertheless, the origins of the Pomatiopsidae, the factors driving such a diverse radiation and aspects of their co-evolution with Schistosoma are not fully understood. Many taxonomic questions remain; there are problems identifying medically relevant species. The predicted range is mostly unsurveyed and the true biodiversity of the family is underestimated. Consequently, the aim of the study was to collect DNA-sequence data for as many pomatiopsid taxa as possible, as a first step in providing a resource for identification of epidemiologically significant species (by non-malacologists), for use in resolving taxonomic confusion and for testing phylogeographical hypotheses.

Plans are under consideration for at least 12 hydroelectric power dams on the lower Mekong river and much controversy surrounds predictions of their environmental impacts. Unfortunately, there are almost no ecological data (such as long-term population trend studies) available for N. aperta which could be used in impact assessment. Predictions currently assume that the impacts will be the same as those observed in Africa (i.e., a worsening of the schistosomiasis problem); however, marked ecological differences between the snails involved suggest that region specific models are required. The present study was performed as an initial step in providing data, which could be useful in the planning of water resource development in the Mekong. Snail population density records were analyzed for populations close to, and far downstream of, the Nam Theun 2 (NT2) project in Laos in order to detect any changes that might be attributable to impoundment.   RESULTS  The population immediately downstream of NT2 and that sampled 400 km downstream in Thailand both showed a long-term trend of slow growth from 1992 to 2005; however, both populations showed a marked decline in density between 2005 and 2011. The decline in Thailand was to a value significantly lower than that predicted by a linear mixed model for the data, whilst the population density close to NT2 fell to undetectable levels in 2011 from densities of over 5000 m(-2) in 2005. The NT2 dam began operation in 2010.   CONCLUSIONS  The impact of the NT2 dam on N. aperta population density could be more complex than first thought and may reflect the strict ecological requirements of this snail. There was no indication that responses of N. aperta populations to dam construction are similar to those observed with Bulinus and Schistosoma haematobium in Africa, for example. In view of the present findings, more ecological data (in particular population density monitoring and surveillance for new habitats) are urgently required in order to understand properly the likely impacts of water resource development on Mekong schistosomiasis.","tags":null,"title":"Observations on Neotricula aperta (Gastropoda: Pomatiopsidae) population densities in Thailand and central Laos: implications for the spread of Mekong schistosomiasis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen W.

Indoplanorbis is of economic importance in that it is responsible for the transmission of several species of the genus Schistosoma which infect cattle and cause reduced livestock productivity. The snail is also of medical importance as a source of cercarial dermatitis among rural workers, particularly in India. In spite of its long history and wide geographical range, it is thought that Indoplanorbis includes only a single species. The aims of the present study were to date the radiation of Indoplanorbis across Asia so that the factors involved in its dispersal in the region could be tested, to reveal potential historical biogeographical events shaping the phylogeny of the snail, and to look for signs that I. exustus might be polyphyletic.RESULTS:The results indicated a radiation beginning in the late Miocene with a divergence of an ancestral bulinine lineage into Assam and peninsular India clades. A Southeast Asian clade diverged from the peninsular India clade late-Pliocene; this clade then radiated at a much more rapid pace to colonize all of the sampled range of Indoplanorbis in the mid-Pleistocene.CONCLUSIONS:The phylogenetic depth of divergences between the Indian clades and Southeast Asian clades, together with habitat and parasitological differences suggest that I. exustus may comprise more than one species. The timescale estimated for the radiation suggests that the dispersal to Arabia and to Southeast Asia was facilitated by palaeogeographical events and climate change, and did not require human involvement. Further samples from Afghanistan, Africa and western India are required to refine the phylogeographical hypothesis and to include the African Recent dispersal.","tags":null,"title":"The phylogeography of Indoplanorbis exustus (Gastropoda: Planorbidae) in Asia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.W.

Oocysts and/or sporocysts from three taxa of Sarcocystis were collected from human, feline, and canine definitive hosts that had fed upon meats infected with the muscle cysts of Sarcocystis hominis, Sarcocystis fusiformis and a species of Sarcocystis from water buffalo that could not be distinguished from Sarcocystis cruzi. Using a new collection method employing filter paper, these excreted oocysts and sporocysts were subjected to DNA extraction, as were the corresponding muscle cysts. Methods employing PCR-RFLP and DNA sequencing of a partial 18S rDNA gene (ssrRNA) sequence were then used to successfully distinguish among the three taxa. The same, unique restriction digestion pattern characterizes the tissue cysts and oocysts and/or sporocysts of each parasite taxon. The technique makes possible amplification and identification of species specific gene sequences based on DNA extracted from as few as 7 excreted sporocysts (the equivalent of 3 and 1/2 oocysts) from freshly prepared material, or as few as 50 sporocysts from feces samples that had been stored in potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) for as long as 6 years. This represents the first report using molecular diagnostic procedures to diagnose oocysts of Sarcocystis in faecal samples, describing a valuable new tool for studying the epidemiology of various Sarcocystis species.","tags":["Diagnostics","18S rRNA","Faeces","Oocysts"],"title":"Non-invasive methods for identifying oocysts of Sarcocystis spp. from definitive hosts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.
